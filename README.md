## Getting Started
Right in the following sections, there'll be steps of how to build and run the project locally.
### Prerequisites
Maven - version 3.5 or higher.<br/>
Java - JDK version 8 or higher.
### Building the project
To build the project, go to the project root folder and run:
```sh
mvn clean package
```
## Running the project 
After building the project, a .jar file will be available in the `target` folder. You can run the project by running:
```sh
cd ./target
java -jar ToDo-List-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
Another way of doing that, without the need of running the previous steps is by running:
```sh
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```
